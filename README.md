# Vim no color collections

A list of Vim color themes with barely any colors. Go ahead, compare and
**contrast**.

### [pgdouyon/vim-yin-yang](https://github.com/pgdouyon/vim-yin-yang)

> Yin-Yang is a black and white color scheme for Vim and is heavily inspired by
> [preto][] and [base16-grayscale][].
>
> I liked preto's subtle use of colors in a black/white colorscheme but found
> the contrast too high for my liking, so I created Yin-Yang as a low contrast
> version of preto.

### [ewilazarus/preto](https://github.com/ewilazarus/preto)

> A minimal dark color scheme for VIM, inspired by badwolf and 256_noir.

### [chriskempson/base16-vim](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-vim)

> See the [Base16 repository](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) for more
> information.

- [Dark](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-vim/blob/master/colors/base16-grayscale-dark.vim)
- [Light](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-vim/blob/master/colors/base16-grayscale-light.vim)

### [andreasvc/vim-256noir](https://github.com/andreasvc/vim-256noir)

> A dark 256-color color scheme for vim.
>
> Have you ever wondered why most syntax highlighting of source code is about as
> subtle and pretty as a candy shop explosion? A technical reason is the
> historical constraints imposed by 16 color terminals, but fortunately this
> limitation is easy to overcome.

### [davidosomething/vim-colors-meh](https://github.com/davidosomething/vim-colors-meh)

> > A 256-color / 24-bit Vim color scheme, with preference for contrast over
> > hues.
>
> It works for me, just publishing it in case someone has similar taste and
> wants to use it.

### [pbrisbin/vim-colors-off](https://github.com/pbrisbin/vim-colors-off)

> For a number of weeks, I ran vim with `syntax off`. It was quite nice, with
> only two annoyances:
>
> - Bright white on jet black was a bit off-putting.
> - There were cases when I did miss the lack of color, vimdiff for example.
>
> Therefore, I aimed to find or create a colorscheme to solve these two issues.
>
> The result is very much based on the [pencil][] colorscheme, which is
> surprising because it's a very colorful colorscheme, but:
>
> - It uses a very sane approach to defining and setting colors
> - It has nice background and foreground colors
> - In the areas where I do want color, I like how it colors things

### [Jorengarenar/vim-darkness](https://github.com/Jorengarenar/vim-darkness)

> Simple monochrome Vim colorscheme focused on indulgeing into the darkness

### [owickstrom/vim-colors-paramount](https://github.com/owickstrom/vim-colors-paramount)

> A minimal colorscheme for Vim that only puts emphasis on the paramount.

### [rj-white/vim-colors-paramountblue](https://github.com/rj-white/vim-colors-paramountblue)

> A minimal colorscheme for Vim that only puts emphasis on the paramount.
>

### [reedes/vim-colors-pencil](https://github.com/reedes/vim-colors-pencil)

> A light (and dark) color scheme for Vim inspired by iA Writer

### [huyvohcmc/atlas.vim](https://github.com/huyvohcmc/atlas.vim)

> Probably the purest black and white vim colorscheme you can find on the

### [Lokaltog/vim-monotone](https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-monotone)

> Another monochrome vim colorscheme. Inspired by various
> [other](https://github.com/ewilazarus/preto)
> [monochrome](https://github.com/pbrisbin/vim-colors-off)
> [colorschemes](https://github.com/fxn/vim-monochrome).
>
> Monotone is a middle ground between a regular colorscheme and
> [no syntax highlighting at all](https://www.kyleisom.net/blog/2012/10/17/syntax-off/).
> The colorscheme differentiates comments, strings and keywords with different
> weights and shades of gray. It emphasizes errors, warnings and search
> highlighting as shown in the screenshots below.

### [fxn/vim-monochrome](https://github.com/fxn/vim-monochrome)

> A dark Vim color scheme for your focused hacking session.

### [robertmeta/nofrils](https://github.com/robertmeta/nofrils)

### [zaki/zazen](https://github.com/zaki/zazen)

> zazen vim color scheme (a personalized version of zenesque).

### [bdd/noclown.vim](https://github.com/bdd/.vim/blob/master/colors/noclown.vim)

> A mostly color free theme with a goal of not making your code look like a clown threw up.

### [axvr/photon.vim](https://github.com/axvr/photon.vim)

> Photon is a low-contrast colour scheme, which cares about the little details.
> It is based on an old version of [paramount](https://github.com/owickstrom/vim-colors-paramount)
> and is designed to look exactly the same on 256 colour terminals as it does on
> true colour terminals.

### [~romainl/vim-bruin](https://git.sr.ht/~romainl/vim-bruin)

> A Vim colorscheme with just enough color to deserve its job title.
>
> * should use colors *only* for UI-related highlight groups
> * should *only* use combinations of **b**old, **r**everse, **u**nderline, **i**talic, and **N**ONE for syntax-related highlight groups
> * should work the same on *light* and *dark* background without human intervention

### [andreypopp/vim-colors-plain](https://github.com/andreypopp/vim-colors-plain)

> Minimalistic colorscheme which uses bold to highlight keywords and a distinguished color for constant literals (string, numbers, JSX tags).

### [danishprakash/vim-yami](https://github.com/danishprakash/vim-yami)

> Monochromatic dark(é—‡) theme for Vim

### [ajgrf/parchment](https://github.com/ajgrf/parchment)

> Parchment is an editor theme for Vim and Emacs, inspired by Acme and Leuven. You might like it if you prefer light colorschemes but think black-on-white is too hard on your eyes, or if you find most colorschemes too busy.

### [jaredgorski/fogbell.vim](https://github.com/jaredgorski/fogbell.vim)

> Fogbell is a fork of [SpaceCamp](https://github.com/jaredgorski/SpaceCamp) minus color. It comes with only comments, diff, and hlsearch differentiated out of the box, but the files are easy to edit if you need more (or less) distinction. No bold or italics. Fogbell includes dark, low-contrast, and light variants.
